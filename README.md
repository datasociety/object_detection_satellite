Step 1: Annotate your data
Use your images(in our case satellite images) and annotate the bounding boxes. This has already been done for you using [LabelIMG](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) tool. Watch the [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0nR2YsCY_U&feature=youtu.be) to learn how do annotate images.

Step 2: Run the .ipynb file in Colab.
